### Game Instructions

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.  This is the computer’s score.

Each of the gems will be assigned a hidden random value. By clicking on a gem, you will add its value to your total score.

If your total score matches the computer’s score exactly, then you win the game.

If your total score exceeds the computer’s score, then you lose the game.

Each time a new game starts, the hidden value of each gem will change.
